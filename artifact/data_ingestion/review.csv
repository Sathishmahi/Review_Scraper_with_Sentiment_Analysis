Here is my first impressions after a few days of usage of Redmi Note 7S mobile phone. I bought 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage variant. Pros: * The build quality of the Redmi Note 7S is great considering its price. The overall fit and finish is impeccable and all the metal and glass does make the Note 7S look and feel in hands a more premium phone. * It has corning gorilla glass 5 protection at the front as well as back.* The display sports a full HD+ (1080x2340 pixels) resolution and has a ...,5

"✓ it's just awesome.✓ worth of money.✓ people who look for all like cam, battery, Ram, ROM    price it's fit for that.✓ it's closer to note 7,7pro 4gb ram because of just  small difference in , processor is 672 but 7s has 660 but costs 2000rs less.✓ clock speed is 2.2GHZ in which 7pro has 2GHZ.✓ Just 70min for full charge from 5-100%.✓ Thank you Flipkart.✓ All Rounder product.✓ prefer black or white.",5

after using 8 day's my honest review.....Display: Very good qualityCamera: Rear camera at day light conditions very good but at low light conditions struggle in pictures.Front camera average...Battery: Good but not up to the mark in before 4000 mah some Xiaomi device.Gaming: I'm not game lover that's y no comments for gamin performance.Looks: Stunning. just look like a premium device.very disappointing for MIUI Adds...,3
phone is good but battery life is worst. 4000MAH not lasting for more than one day. Xiaomi need to work on this. Even with very minimal Internet usage battery drained in 1 Day so it need daily charged. Not recommended as many other good phones available in this price range.,2
"it's good , sound is good no issues like 5 pro.network is better than note 4 .camera is good even in night .but no use of 48 MP camera .",5
