"Best smart phone under this price range compare to other phones in 2023 if you see overall build quality, performance and Camera with autofocus and video action mode are awesome50% extra RAM compared to iPhone 13 and other more features. Best time to upgrade to iPhone 14 . I am so happy See Low light photos are amazing..",5
"Damn such a great phone. Camera is really good, battery lasts long enough, super smooth even though its just 60 hz XDR display. Videos with action mode on are insanely stable and crisp.The night mode can take some really good shots jn low light conditions .The whole apple environment itself is so seamless. I shifted from android to iPhone and it barely took any time since I had iPad and a mac already. With a just a few clicks the phone was ready to go.",5

I am so happy to have first time i phone 14. My experience is outstanding to have this phone.But i wanted to have i phone 18 fortunately i have this now.,5
camera is not as expected at evening as pictures are so dull and not bright.so much dissipointed when compare camera even with s21fe or one plus nord or other premium phones.at bright sunlight or in a bright light at night pictures are so good in portrait mode.selfies in low light are terrible. looks like camera under 10k phone.battery is good and last for day easily.performance is so good.display may be if 90hz it will be good at this price range.,4
