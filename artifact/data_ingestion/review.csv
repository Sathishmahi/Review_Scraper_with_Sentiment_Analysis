it's my first Mi phone so I hv to say that its fabulous budget phone with excellent camera.  But I doubt regarding its body SAR values I feel its more than 1.6 while company says it's 0.838Company should be reliable about SAR.* Perfect configuration üíØ‚úåüíò,5

"I ordered it for my mom. Main highlight is #CAMERA and it is outstanding at this price range as you can see in images captured ( experienced some lag & heat during frequent captures at 48MP mode, may be fix after future update ). #CALL_QUALITY is excellent, I personally use it one day. #BATTRY is not long lasting, but I am not gamer so it is ok for one day backup & also it has type C port so charging is fast. #DISPLAY quality is best but gorilla glass got scratches even in pocket, you have to...",4

"Waste of money time and energy. Have purchased this phone a week back and it proved to be waste of money. Lot of problem with dual SIM. Does not support Data from other sim once u have started with another. later does not support from either one. other brand provides dedicated sim slot wothbthe one for memory card. where 7s is hybrid and does not support one with another. 48 megapixel is trap, it only work in pro mode, whereas if anyone buy this range phone never uses pro mode. also not...",1
"Pros:1) Fingerprints & Face unlock is super fast.2) The FHD+ display is excellent and viewing angles.3) Charging is also fast(In-box charger)4) Camera enhances using GCAM. 5MP depth sensor is amazing.5) Snapdragon 660 processor is very good under 10K. Antutu benchmark is 135374.6) I bought 3GB RAM variant, which is working average. The 4GB variant is recommended but you rather buy Note7Pro with 1000 rupees more.Best buy under 10KCons:1) The camera is not as good as Note7Pro. The Sa...",5
Frnds to be honest with you this is the best phone on this budget in may 2019 but I m not hyping you with 48 mp camera. To be honest with you rear is really good n selfie camera is ok if you r not a selfie freak .Build up quality is so good .look is ok performance is good but i dont like the MIUI 10 OS except this SAB ACHCHA HI HAI .,4
"Best product at this price.  Performance is top notch due to 2.2 gHZ clock speed with 660 SD.  Design is same as iPhoneX.Pros:  - Camera - Best quality in night mode,  48 MP AI duel rear camera is heart of the phone.  - Design (same as iPhoneX) - Processor auto switch from 1.8 GHz to 2.2 GHz and vice versa based on usage.  - While unboxing I found trasparent back protection cover,  thx Xiomi. - Battery (when I started phone it has 61% and after 8 hours continuos usage it is 19% now and...",5
